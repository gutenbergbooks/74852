<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> (<i>At fire</i>) Extraordinary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Auntie, we shall be late. Do you hear?
We shall be late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Yes, dear, I think you will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> He promised to go, didn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Yes, dear, he certainly did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I do call it a shame. Horace is the
meanest, most selfish——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Quite right, dear, he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> He thinks of nothing but his books, and
his papers, and his horrid little stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Quite true, dear, he does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Then why do you let him do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Yes, you. You know he is engaged to
me, and yet you allow him to treat me as if we had
been married for years. (<i>Up to window.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> My dear Minnie—(<i>Sits <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> of table</i>)—if
Horace is a little thoughtless, surely it isn’t my fault.
I suppose he has forgotten all about the dance——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Forgotten! (<i>Comes <span class="allsmcap">C.</span></i>) I’ll tell you
what it is. Aunt Martha, you will have to go instead.
(<i>Goes to fire.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Minnie, I can’t. You know, dear, it is
quite impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Impossible? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Well, dear, you know that horrid Louise
hasn’t sent home my dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Nonsense, Aunt Martha. You’ve lots
of dresses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Not one fit to be seen. You know that
perfectly well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> There’s your plum-colored silk——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> My dear child. I wore that all last winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Only about three times. Then there’s
your yellow satin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You know I look a perfect fright in that.
Yellow doesn’t suit me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Nothing suits you to-night. I declare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
you are as bad as Horace! I suppose I shall have
to give up the dance. It is a shame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> My dear, I would have gone with pleasure
if that odious Louise hadn’t disappointed me.
But you wouldn’t have me make an exhibition of
myself. One must have some pride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Pride? You’re all pride. I do believe
if the house were on fire, and you cut off in a top
room, you’d decline the fire-escape unless you were
dressed in the latest Paris fashion. (<i>Goes up to
window.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Well, upon my word, dear, you are not
very polite. I must say that I am very sorry that
you should be disappointed about your dance, but I
don’t believe you’d have cared so very much if you
hadn’t known you were wearing a particularly
pretty frock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> It isn’t that at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> But it is—a very pretty frock. And it
suits you quite wonderfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Does it, Auntie? (<i>Coming to <span class="smcap">Aunt</span>.</i>)
What I meant was I go for the dancing—principally.
I do love dancing. Auntie, don’t you think
you could manage? (<i>Kisses her. Front door
heard to slam.</i>) Ah, that must be Horace.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Horace</span> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> in fur coat. <span class="smcap">Minnie</span> runs to
him and kisses him. <span class="smcap">Horace</span> puts copy of
“The Astronomer” on table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, Horace!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Beastly cold. (<i>Goes to fire.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Horace, I’m so glad you’re here.
We’ve been waiting such a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Waiting? What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Why, for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Have you got a cab?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Cab? What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Well, you know the horses are coughing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Coughing. No wonder—everybody’s
coughing, this beastly weather. I’m coughing—— (<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> (<i>At top of table</i>) Poor dear. How
good of you to go out. When will it be here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> The cab.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I don’t know what you are talking
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> That odious Louise hasn’t sent home my
dress. But there, you two will be all right without
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Without you? Oh, yes, we’ll manage.
(<i>Taking off coat—puts it down on chair <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> below
fireplace.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, Auntie, he isn’t dressed yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Horace, you’ll be late. You’ll miss ever
so many dances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What on earth are you talking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Aren’t you going to the Clarences’ dance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, Horace!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> But you are not going to disappoint
Minnie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Horace, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Mrs. Clarence will be offended if none
of us go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, then, go, by all means. There’s
nothing to prevent you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> But Minnie can’t go without you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Auntie’s dress hasn’t come from
Louise’s, so she can’t go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You promised to take her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I’m not going out again to-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, Horace, how unkind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I call it perfectly mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> It is much too cold. Besides, I want
to read.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I never knew anyone as selfish as you,
Horace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, what keeps you? Why don’t
you go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You know I can’t. I haven’t got a dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, go without it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Horace!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I mean, you can easily find one that
will do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I think men are perfect fools. One that
will do, indeed. Now don’t speak to me any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Kindly listen to me. In spite of my
frightful cough—(<i>Slight cough</i>)—I’ve been out in
the bitter snow to get this copy of the “Astronomer.”
It contains an article on life on the planet
Mars, in which you know I am much interested.
And you ask me to put on thin dress clothes and
go out again, and run tremendous risks with my
delicate throat and supersensitive lungs, and all for
what? To see a lot of fools capering about and
making idiots of themselves until four or five in
the morning. I think you are most inconsiderate—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Horace——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span>—and unreasonable, and selfish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> The impertinence of the man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, never mind. I didn’t understand
that you had anything in particular to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Now, there’s a sensible little girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Sit down here—(<i>Armchair</i>)—and
make yourself thoroughly comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Sitting down, but feeling in all his
pockets</i>) One who realizes that one cannot always
be running about from place to place, neglecting
the serious interests of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> What is it? What are you looking
for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> My cigar case. I fancy I must have
left it in my room. (<i><span class="smcap">Minnie</span> runs <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> to get it.</i>)
Wait a minute. Did I put it down as I came
through the hall? (<i><span class="smcap">Minnie</span> runs <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>) Wait, wait,
I’m not certain I took it out with me at all this
morning, in which case it surely will be in my
study. (<i><span class="smcap">Minnie</span> runs <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) Now, don’t run about.
You make me giddy. Do not run about. Have a
thorough search. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Minnie</span> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Horace, you are going too far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Not I. I am stopping at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You know what I mean. With Minnie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Ah, she’s a dear little girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> She’s one in a thousand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> She is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> She’s much too good for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I don’t know about that. She’s quite
good enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You are perfectly detestable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Yes, and you’re growing worse every
day. (<i>Goes <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) You are simply wrapped up in
selfishness, and egotism, and conceit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Merely because I prefer a quiet evening
to myself and my books? Because I prefer
scientific discovery to heartless frivolity? Absurd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You are forgetting your duty to the girl
you are going to make your wife. You seem to
think because she was adopted by your mother you
have the right to order her about as if she were a
servant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You know you are talking absolute
rot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You make her feel her dependent position,
and I think that very unfair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> But, hang it all, she is not dependent.
My mother provided for her sufficiently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Yes, I know, but everything comes from
our family, and you never allow her to forget the
fact. She considers she owes you a debt of gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> If it comes to that—well, she does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You ought never to let her feel that.
You should try to win her heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Oh, bother. I have won her heart.
We are engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Then try to deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> But I do deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Indeed! And pray, when are you going
to marry her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Oh, that’s all right. There’s no hurry
about that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> No hurry? Horace, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i><span class="smcap">Aunt</span> goes <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) Now, my dear Aunt,
don’t you think you are very unwise to try and
precipitate matters? You have heard that people
who marry in haste very often——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> (<i>Returning to table</i>) You’ll have plenty
of leisure for repentance shortly, but it will be
for quite a different reason. Minnie will wake up
presently and see you as you really are. She is a
most attractive girl. You’ll feel pretty miserable
when you have lost her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Ridiculous. Minnie knows when she
is well off. Hullo. I could have sworn I felt in
that pocket! (<i>Finds cigar case.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> What is it? (<i>Sees case. Aside</i>) Hopeless,
hopeless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> That’s a bit of bad luck, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Bad luck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I might have been smoking all this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
time. (<i>Lights up.</i>) There’s nothing like a good
cigar, after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> There’s nothing like a good wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, of course I don’t know anything
about that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I believe you prefer the cigar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> To women? In some respects I think
I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Oh, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> For one thing, a cigar doesn’t talk.
And when you have finished with one, you can
begin another.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Minnie</span> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I can’t find your cigar case anywhere.

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> In my pocket all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> (<i>Goes to him and places cushions in
chair</i>) There, now. Are you nice and comfortable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No. Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Don’t speak to him, dear. He isn’t
worth it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Now, Auntie dear, I must make my
boy cosy, and then I think I shall go to bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> What? Give up the dance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, never mind about that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Horace, I ask you, have you the heart
to let Minnie sacrifice her pleasure for you in this
way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> But, Auntie, it doesn’t matter, really
it doesn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I’m very angry with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I am not sacrificing her pleasure, it’s
you. Why don’t you go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You know I can’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> There’s nothing to prevent you, except
your absurd vanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> For shame, Horace!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Vanity indeed! How dare you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> It’s perfectly true. It’s just your nonsense
about a dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Very well, then, you shall see. I will
go. I don’t care how I look.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> And I am sure I don’t, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Minnie shan’t be deprived of her evening.
I’ll put on my yellow satin and look a perfect
fright.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I’ll believe you when I see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I have quite given up the idea,
Auntie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> But I haven’t. You shall see, Horace, I
keep my word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Oh, devil doubt you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Whatever it costs me, I’ll do my duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I don’t want to inflict this on you,
Auntie dear. I’m quite content to go to bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Content. Oh, yes, I understand your
content. But you shall go, my dear, to as many
balls and parties as possible. You shall go to Ascot
and Henley and Goodwood and Cowes. We’ll find
escorts easily enough. You shall see plenty of new
faces. I’ll take care of that. Vanity, indeed! I’ll
teach him to call me vain! (<i>Starts to exit <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> when

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Yes, ma’m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> What a relief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What a relief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Auntie, isn’t that splendid luck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Madame Louise hopes it will be in time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Just in time. Take it up to my room at
once. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Bella</span> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) I won’t keep you waiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
any longer than I can help. You’ll find Horace
such a delightful companion, so witty and entertaining.
Oh, don’t speak to him, then you won’t
get any uncivil answers. (<i>Exit <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>After a pause, looks up from his
paper</i>) Got the jumps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> You must have said something to upset
her. She isn’t often like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I should hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> She’ll be all right to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> That’s the worst of women, they’re so
illogical, aren’t they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I suppose they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You know, she thinks I ought to have
gone with you to-night. That’s because she only
looks at it from her own standpoint. Can’t take a
broad view of the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Is yours the broad view?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Naturally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> How did you acquire this breadth of
mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Can hardly say that. Just seems to
belong to the masculine intellect. Men see all
round a subject. Women don’t. They’re circumscribed.
Can’t see over the hedge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Could you teach me to see over the
hedge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I might be able to a certain extent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Will you begin by explaining your
broad view to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> That was quite simple. Aunt Martha
wanted me to go because she didn’t want to go
herself. The only view she could take.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> And you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Of course my viewpoint was very different.
I had already been out in the snow once to
get this month’s “Astronomer,” and there wasn’t
any reason why I should go out again. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
discussion about life on Mars this month, which I
am following closely. It wouldn’t have done Aunt
Martha any good to stop at home and read the
article, because, being practically devoid of brains,
she wouldn’t have understood a word about it.
Then again, women ought to go to dances, which
are got up entirely for their benefit. Whereas
men hate that kind of frivolity. So it was obviously
her duty to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You see, Aunt Martha couldn’t take
in all these points because her mind isn’t broad
enough to grasp them. The consequence was her
view was very narrow and rather selfish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> You certainly put it very clearly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I am glad you can appreciate my reasoning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, I can. But one thing I see very
plainly, and that is that you both are putting yourselves
to inconvenience on my account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No, dear, I assure you I am not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> That’s true. Thank you for reminding
me. But I hate to think I should be so much
trouble to you both. Of course I know I have no
real claim upon you. It isn’t as if I were your
very own sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I should think not, indeed. You’re
going to be my wife. Just think of that.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Minnie</span> goes to him above table <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Horace, tell me. Do you love me?
Really, really love me? Or are you going to marry
me because it was your mother’s wish? (<i><span class="smcap">Horace</span>
kisses her hand.</i>) You mustn’t be angry with me.
Perhaps I expect too much, but I think I should be
happier if you were just a little bit more—ah, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
loving in your manner. Oh, Horace, Horace, I
don’t want you to marry me out of pity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> My dear child, don’t be silly! (<i>Takes
her hand.</i>) I do love you! I love you most awfully,
but I am not what is called a demonstrative
man. Few scientific men are, I fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Do you know, I’m almost sorry you
are such a scientific man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i><span class="smcap">Minnie</span> takes his left hand</i>) Minnie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Love and science don’t seem to agree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Oh, yes, they do. But you don’t understand.
I love you in a scientific way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I think I like the old way best. But
I suppose I am silly and narrow minded like Aunt
Martha. (<i>Kisses him.</i>) There, we won’t say any
more about it. Are you comfortable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No, not at all. You might get another
pillow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> (<i>Does so.</i>) Shall I put you out the
whiskey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Um—yes—you may as well. (<i><span class="smcap">Minnie</span>
gets whiskey from table <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> and two syphons
and jar of biscuits. Aside</i>) Dear little girl. How
she does love me! I must get her a ring, or a pin,
or a thimble to-morrow. That will make her perfectly
happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I’ll pour you out a glass. Say when.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Upon my word, you are a perfect
treasure!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, Horace, do you really mean it?
(<i>Pauses in pouring.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Of course I mean it—but go on pouring,
don’t stop. Now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Don’t sit up too late, dear. You
mustn’t work too hard. You’ll strain your eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No danger, but I shall want some more
oil in the lamp. Will you please tell Bella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Certainly. Now promise me you
won’t tire yourself. (<i>Kisses him.</i>) Promise.</p>

love I should fail, and I see now you have none to
offer me. The devotion of your life is for yourself
and yourself alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> And all this fuss because I don’t want
you to go with a silly ass to a dance to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> No. For your utter lack of consideration.
I might hurt my dear friend, Kitty Clarence,
by not going to her dance. Oh, that was nothing!
Disappoint Auntie—nothing—give up my own
pleasure—nothing—insult a visitor—nothing, nothing
at all. Here it is, Horace. (<i>Puts ring on table.</i>)
I cannot wear it. The gold seems to have gone
out of it. (<i>Exit <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> And that’s the girl I’ve been talking
to about broad views! (<i>Working round table to
paper on the floor.</i>) Well, I’ve met some narrow-minded
people in my life, but she is far and away
the most narrow-minded of the lot. (<i>Picks up
paper.</i>) It’s very disappointing, that’s what it is,
very disappointing. Women are all alike. No
liberality, no generosity. You think you have
found an exception, you pour out all the wealth
of your priceless love upon her, and the moment
the shoe pinches—there you are. I suppose she
will want to make it up to-morrow, then I shall
have to put down my foot and come to a thorough
understanding. Confound that fellow Dicey! It’s
all his fault. I never ought to have allowed him
to take her. I ought to have gone myself. Damn
Dicey! Now for this article. I suppose I’d better
read it. Don’t feel a bit like it. However, it may
act as a sedative. (<i>Settles down to read.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> (<i>Entering <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>) Please, sir, there’s a man
wants to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> A what wants to what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> A man to see you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What does he want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> I don’t know, sir. He says he has a
letter for you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Why didn’t he give it to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> He wouldn’t trust it out of his hand,
sir. He says he must give it to you himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What sort of a man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Well, sir, he seems to think he is a respectable
sort of a man, but he’s what I should call
a tramp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> A tramp? Well, I can’t see him, then.
I can’t see him. Tell him to come again in the
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> I told him that, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, what did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Well, sir, he said he was a persevering
kind of man, but he’s what I should call obstinate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> He said he wouldn’t go away till he had
seen you—and I don’t think he will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> It is too maddening. I can’t have one
moment to myself. Very well, show him in. Show
him in. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Bella</span>.</i>) First of all Aunt Martha,
then that fool Dicey, then Minnie and now a
tramp.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Bella</span> with <span class="smcap">Tramp</span>. Exit <span class="smcap">Bella</span> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, what is it? What is it? What
do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Mr. Brampton told me to give you this.
(<i>Hands letter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Mr. Brampton—of Coventry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Reading</i>) “—might be able to give
him some work.” I haven’t any work to give you.
“Clever workman—seen better days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> That’s true enough. I never see any
worse than what I’m getting now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I’m afraid I cannot help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Don’t be hard, Guv’ner. I’m cold and
tired. I’ve walked all the way from Coventry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Walked? Why, Mr. Brampton says
here he has given you the money for your railway
fare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> So he did, sir. I had a bit of bad luck
with that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What? Lost it, I suppose. (<i>Half
laughing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Not exactly, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Spent it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> How? Drink?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Yes, drink and meat. There’s no crime
in that, is there? Even a tramp must eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Yes, and drink. Well, and when the
money was gone——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> I had to walk. That’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, that’s what you will have to do
now. I can’t help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Just my luck! (<i>Going.</i>) Beg pardon,
Guv’ner, do you feel like standing me a drink before
I go, just to keep out the cold?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Shrugs his shoulders</i>) Help yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> (<i>Drinks glass of whiskey <span class="smcap">Minnie</span> had
poured out</i>) Ah, that’s good! That brings back
old times. You wouldn’t think, Guv’ner, that I
was a prosperous man once. (<i><span class="smcap">Horace</span> indicates
that whiskey is responsible.</i>) No, it wasn’t drink
that ruined me. Drink may have kept me down,
but it didn’t throw me. I’m an engineer by trade—leastways,
I was, but I ain’t worked at it now these
five years. Thank you kindly for the whiskey.
Good night, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Care to take another?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Thank you, sir, I would. (<i>Helps himself.</i>)
Your health, Guv’ner! You wouldn’t think
there was much of the inventor about me? Would
you? But I’ve got some ideas, good uns too, only
I ain’t got the capital, see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> I’ll let you into one of my ideas, Guv’ner,
if you’ll take it up. It’ll make your fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Thanks. I have all the money I require.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Have you, now? I haven’t, that’s the
difference. Feels pretty comfortable, doesn’t it? I
was doing very well once, over there in the States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> America?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Yes. They’re pretty smart there, but
I showed them I was as good as they. I made a
steam valve that’s on most boilers to-day. Yes, I
did. Just me. I got ten thousand dollars down
before I got my papers out. But my partner got
ahead of me. I never saw another cent. I fought
him as long as the money lasted. But it didn’t go
far in the Courts of <i>Justice</i>. It was the Law as
downed me, Guv’ner. Drink?—only damned me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Too bad. You must try again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Not much chance of that. One can’t
do anything without a little capital, and who’s going
to trust me? No, I’ll pick up a living how I
can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> How do you pick up a living?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Anyhow. Running after cabs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Surely to goodness, nobody pays you
for doing that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> If I’m lucky I gets the job of lifting
down the luggage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Oh, that’s it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> There’s a lovely fall of snow to-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Cold comfort for you, I should have
thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> I may get a job shovelling it in the
morning—if I am in luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Why don’t you go back to your old
trade?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Why don’t I go back to my old trade?
Why don’t I? Who’s going to take me on? Who’ll
give me a job? Will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I told you I can’t do anything for
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Then what’s the good of asking? But
it don’t matter. I’ve got nothing to live for now.
Nothing to save for. The Law broke me up, killed
the missus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You were married, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Any children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> One. God forgive me. (<i>Affected.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Care to take another? Some biscuits
if you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> I ain’t proud. Thank you, Guv’ner.
You’re a good un. I worked my way back to England
only to find my missus dead and the little un
gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Gone? How gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> The people she had been with had left,
and I never could find out what had become of her.
Poor little Minnie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Minnie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> That was her name, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Minnie? (<i>Rising and his manner
hardening.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Everything gone. Why should I care?
Care! I beg pardon, sir. The whiskey set me
talking. My story can’t interest you. Good night,
sir. Perhaps if I come back in a day or two you
might know of a job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No. Quite useless. I can do nothing
for you. Get along, now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Good night, sir. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Tramp</span> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Minnie! Minnie! How dare he mention
her name? Of course she couldn’t possibly
have anything to do with him. But it did give me
a turn. Poor devil, I suppose I was rather rough
on him. Never mind, serves him right. I dare
say he deserved it. Anyhow, it will prevent him
coming back again to-morrow. (<i>About to drink.</i>)
Confound him, he has used my glass! (<i>Fetches
another from table <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) It seems to me I am curiously
unlucky. I can’t think why people are so
unfair to me. I’m such a good sort. I don’t know
anyone who has a better temper or a more generous,
open disposition. I expect that is the secret
of it. (<i>Puts whiskey, glasses and biscuits on small
table above fireplace.</i>) Other people are so mean,
and selfish, and unfair. (<i>Sits in armchair.</i>) Now
let me get on with it. (<i>Reads “Astronomer.”</i>)
Where was I? Ah, yes, here we are. (<i>Reads.</i>)
“Latest observations have revealed strange lights
which some astronomers believe to be signals put
out in the hope of an answer from Earth.” I don’t
believe a word of it. It may be possible, though.
If Mars is inhabited, I wonder what they are like.
Are they savages, or are they ahead of us? (<i>Lamp
flickers a little.</i>) Confound it! The lamp’s going
out. Minnie never told her. Forgets all about a
poor fellow left alone in the dark. Most selfish of
her. (<i>Turns over page and reads by firelight as
lamp fails more and more.</i>) Ah, just the end.
(<i>Reads.</i>) “The advent of a messenger or an army
from Mars should not seem to us of the twentieth
century a greater marvel than did the shining sails
of Columbus to the aborigines of America. What
an unfolding of wisdom would their coming yield.
What problems could they solve, what new ones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
set us. The mind fails in contemplation. Too
vast—vast.” (<i>Lamp goes out. <span class="smcap">Horace</span> falls
asleep. Enter <span class="smcap">A Messenger from Mars</span>.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">(N.B. <i>If the lamp has the classical figure suggested,
this will now be removed while the
stage is dark and a proportionately larger one
substituted in which an actor takes the place of
the small figure. The lamp-shade will now be
approximately four feet in diameter. If the
figure does not form a part of the lamp ornamentation
in the first instance it will remain
simply as a lamp, and the actor takes up a
position about <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> while stage is dark, and the
lights growing bring him slowly into view. A
good effect is obtained by blacking out all the
stage except the small part <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> showing <span class="smcap">Horace</span>

upon him. A gentle roll of thunder should announce
the arrival of the <span class="smcap">Messenger</span>. The
following is <span class="smcap">Horace’s</span> dream.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Man! Man of Earth! Give heed
for the good of your kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Hullo. Who are you? (<i>Drowsily.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I am a Messenger from Mars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Don’t believe a word of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I am a Messenger from Mars.
(<i>Sternly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Are you really? Won’t you sit down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Have a drink, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Worm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Meaning me? I note that politeness
is at a discount in Mars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> We are not upon that planet now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I thank my stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Know you why I am here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No more than why the other tramp
bothered me. You have come rather farther—you
may stay a little longer. From the venturesome
spirit that prompted this visit I conclude you are
of the greatest of your race.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I am the poorest gifted, most unhappy,
lowest fallen, and easiest spared. I am a
criminal, and therefore condemned to make this
journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What had you been up to? Do tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I sinned in vanity. A dear companion
and myself had composed a hymn of praise.
He died, and I gave it forth as entirely my own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Gleefully</i>) Did you make much out
of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> It was chanted by many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Then it paid pretty well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> In Mars we do not write for gain.
For five days I endured the bitterest remorse when
I confessed my crime, and was sentenced to make
this journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Doubtless you have learnt that I am
interested in your world and quite rightly expected
a sympathetic welcome from me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> No. But of all countries yours
seemed the most promising field——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Bravo! Rule, Britannia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Of all cities, this London, the
greatest, and most intense——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Good old London!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> And of all its citizens yourself the
most striking example—(<i><span class="smcap">Horace</span> bows</i>)—of the
Greed and Egoism of the age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Staggering to his feet and about to
rush at <span class="smcap">Messenger</span></i>) Hullo! I’ll not stand for
this! Get out of my——</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Messenger</span> raises his arm and <span class="smcap">Horace</span> receives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
an electric shock which reels him back into his
chair. The furniture may be arranged to
shake and rock about as if under the same influence.
<span class="smcap">Messenger</span> refrains and <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
slowly recovers himself.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Are you properly impressed, or shall
I——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No, no! Don’t do it again, please! It
hurts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Good! Now listen with heart and
mind. You have learnt that Mars has a planetary
lifetime brief compared with Earth, and yet we
Martians are to you as are you to the cattle that
you breed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> As bad as that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Triflers of Time, learn the cause.
Self—<i>Self</i> is the Miasm of the world you live in; a
soul plague blotching Earth’s body over with its
petty spites, outraged homes, labor riots, revolutions,
civil wars, carnivals of blood, marring the
Grand Purpose. No war has ever wasted Mars, nor
could it. There have been no rushings back, no
buried epochs, no sleeping centuries, for Self was
unmasked at the beginning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Mask? What mask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Self wears a thousand, making a
counterfeit of every virtue. The soldier’s glory, the
painter’s touch, the statesman’s aim, the poet’s dream
hide something still of self behind them. Even your
children are becoming egoists—the saddest sign of
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Very sad and quite true, but why tell
me all this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> You are the chosen subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> But why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Considering your opportunities, you
are the basest, the most selfish of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> My opportunities?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> In your house is one whose impulses
are fully half unselfish, the maid Minnie. You
couldn’t spare one evening to make her happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> She took such a narrow view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Shame on you! Shame! Then there
is your aunt——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Oh, she is awfully narrow, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Silence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> If you’d lived in the house as long as I
have with Aunt——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Silence! Too lazy to call a cab.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You don’t make any allowance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> You deserve none. Again, there was
that poor unfortunate who in a weak moment confided
to you his life’s tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You can’t make me responsible for that
dirty tramp’s condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> You might have saved him. You
would have been blessed a thousandfold if you had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> In what a hideous Pretence you live.
There, before you, stood a man of genius. You
drove him out to die. An Inventor perishing in the
hey-day of Invention-Worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Do you really think that fellow’s ideas
are good for anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> You a man of science! You know
nothing at all. There is more in his little finger than
your whole body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Look here. If you’ll guarantee him—and
with your inside knowledge of things generally—I
might hunt him up to-morrow and set him
going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> You will?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Yes. Of course, you do guarantee him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> For whose benefit would you do
this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I should expect to come in, of course—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Hypocrite! Beyond belief hypocrite!
You train your dogs with hunger and a whip.
It seems I must try that system upon you. Get up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What are you going to do now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> You must come with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Not out into the snow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Yes, into the snow and the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Do let me explain. The fact is I am in
rather a delicate state of health, and if I were to
venture out on a night like this, the consequences
might be most serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> You are wasting your breath.
Come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You can’t really mean it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You will let me put on my coat and
hat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Put them on. We may find them
useful. Hurry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Putting on his coat and muffler slowly</i>)
You don’t give me time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Make haste, I say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I’m not starting out with any comfort
at all. I really don’t think I should be wise to venture
out to-night. It is so very sharp outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Do you hear me? Come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No. I’m damned if I do! (<i><span class="smcap">Messenger</span>
raises his arm, and again <span class="smcap">Horace</span> is electrified and
the furniture thrown into a commotion. <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
sinks to his knees in front of <span class="smcap">Messenger</span> in terror.</i>)
I’ll come! I’ll come!</p>

Road. You might find one there, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> But you don’t think I will?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Policeman.</span> It’s doubtful, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Look here, I wish you would get me a
taxi or four-wheeler, anything. I don’t care what
it is. Here’s a half crown for you. If you bring
it back in ten minutes I’ll double it with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Policeman.</span> (<i>Takes coin</i>) Thank you, sir. Will
you wait here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Here or hereabouts. Bring it as near
as the road will let you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Policeman.</span> All right, sir. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Policeman</span>
<span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Splendid force, the police. I believe
this is the best hiding place I can find. (<i>Descends
area steps and disappears from view. Enter <span class="smcap">Messenger</span>
<span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> My foolish rabbit! Come from your
hole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Much discomfited—comes up again</i>)
Rabbit! Beastly personal! Oh, there you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Trying to hide?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I’ve been looking for you everywhere—even
down in that area. Where have you been?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> The policeman will not find a cab.
I have taken care of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Aside</i>) He must have been listening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I have brought you here....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You brought me? (<i>Dejected.</i>) There
is no escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> None whatever. (<i><span class="smcap">Horace</span> astounded
to find his thought read by <span class="smcap">Messenger</span>.</i>) Look
around. Do you know where you are?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>The front of the house is a transparency
and now lights up from within and shows a
ballroom. Ladies and gentlemen strolling about between
dances.</i>) I declare, if it isn’t Mrs. Clarence’s!
In full swing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I have brought you here where you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
refused to come to-night to give you your first lesson
in <i>Otherdom</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What’s that? Otherdom, you say?
(<i>Interior again dark.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> You do not understand? It is characteristic
of your race that while all that is vile and
ignoble is well expressed by your word “Selfishness,”
your language does not supply its opposite. In Mars
we have a word which means the abandonment of
self and the striving for others. It is the great essential
virtue, <i>Otherdom</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Thank you. I will bear it in mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> On your life show it in your acts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Oh, I will. May I go home now; it’s
very chilly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Poor thing of Temperature! Your
scientists still leave you slaves of the weather.
What braggarts are you to dream as yet of civilization!
When you can weave water into clothing,
spin fire into ribbons, and wear them in the altitudes,
you shall speak of some advancement. Your mills
of Fashion sigh and hum, but not one of you can
outdress a butterfly. Yet the New Times would
rush upon you had Otherdom a place with you.
That is the substance of which Knowledge is but
the shadow playing about it—growing as it grows.
You seek to puff out the shadow—it will be shadow
merely while Time’s torch burns. Look yonder.
Who comes? Speak to her.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Enter a Woman outcast.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No, thank you. I’d rather not. I warn
you, if you are seen you will have an awful crowd
round you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I am visible to no eyes but yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> That’s clever. How do you do it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> She is turning back. I will bring
her to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I wish you wouldn’t. You can’t realize——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I know more of your world than
you do. She is returning.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>The Woman has sauntered on, looked at <span class="smcap">Horace</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Stay! (<i><span class="smcap">Horace</span> is pulled up.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I don’t care to be seen talking to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Help her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Look here, I’m not invisible, and if I
am seen by anybody in this house—— Oh, Lor’!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> She comes. Another kind of wreck
on the reefs of Self.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Outcast.</span> You’ll catch cold, dear, if you don’t
come indoors. (<i><span class="smcap">Horace</span> turns his back on her.</i>)
Bah, you! Give me a tanner to get a drink with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Good night! Good night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Help her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I have no silver left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Give her gold. Give her gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Gold—there’s none in circulation. Do
you know what she is? A vile wanton, a plague of
the streets!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> No more! Dare man so speak of
women? Oh, are you not Joint Guardians of the
Future? Give, Horace, give.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Horace</span> gives a pound note. She looks at it and
becomes half hysterical.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Outcast.</span> It’s a pound, sir—a pound note. Did
you mean it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I had to give you something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Outcast.</span> Bless your good heart! It’ll pay the
rent, sir. We won’t have to turn out. You don’t
know what a lift it is, sir. Thank you, thank you,
sir. Good night, sir. Good night, sir. Oh, bless
you! (<i>Exit <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Is it not blessed to give?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I dare say you find it quite funny. It
must be blessed to give away other people’s money.
It was you gave it, mind, not I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Then you cannot expect any blessing
from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> It strikes me I am getting the worst
of it all round. How much longer is this foolery
to go on? You’ll never bring me to your way of
thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> So they all said in Mars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You are in for a long visit. Now where
will you put up? I can’t take you in myself, but
how about our Moon? I make you a present of the
Moon—and you can put a fence round it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> The Moon is not yours to give.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> That is why I make you a present of it.
I’m taking a leaf out of your book. You give away
my money, so I give you somebody else’s Moon.
That in practice appears to be your delightful
Otherdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> It is not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, why are you trying to convert me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Your conversion is a condition of
my return.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Exultingly</i>) Self! Self! Who’s selfish
now, Marsy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I shall rejoice in saving you no less
that the task is imposed upon me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You are doomed to failure. Give it
up—and please let me go home. I’m nearly always
in bed by half-past eleven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> No. Your lesson is only just beginning.
Have you forgotten Minnie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Forgotten her? Rather not! Dear
little girl! She is awfully gone on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Hush, hush! She is one whom it
pains to see a fault in you. Love, the elementary
Otherdom, possesses her. A divine gift of madness
set in opposition to the cold logic of Self. She did
love you——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Did? She does, and don’t you make
any mistake about it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Listen a while. (<i>Waves his hand
and the interior of house lights up and discovers
<span class="smcap">Minnie</span> and <span class="smcap">Dicey</span> chatting.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> This is our dance, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Isn’t it a lovely dance? I’m so glad
we came, and it was all thanks to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> Oh, you mustn’t thank me any more. I’m
over-rewarded. But is Mr. Parker often like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> He is rather peculiar at times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Indignant</i>) I—peculiar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> Peculiar? That seems a mild epithet to
apply to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I’m almost inclined to agree with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> He is a selfish beast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I—selfish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> He refused to come to-night after he
had promised—promised faithfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> Pearls before swine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I’ll swine him when I get hold of him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> And he wouldn’t even fetch us a cab.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> But he said he was just going out to get
one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> That was an awful fib because you were
there and he was ashamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> Ashamed? He might well be. He must
be going off his head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> This doesn’t interest me in the least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> No? Hear a little more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> He gave me a fright, though—one terrible
fright.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Did he? How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> He spoke a word and all the beauty of
life seemed to shrivel up and die away. And then
somebody not far away contradicted him. In a moment
the cloud was gone and the whole world seemed
even brighter and happier than it had been before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Lor’, the fellow thinks he is making
love! Makes me sick to hear him. I’d like to kick
him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> What right have you to stand in
the way of this young man who gives love for love?
You don’t love her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I think I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> He knows he does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Minnie knows I do, but she doesn’t want
to be reminded of it every minute or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> A great mistake. Women don’t like
to be taken for granted. Listen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> What could he ever be to you? Certainly
no companion for life. He? He is only fit
to be a bit of furniture in a library, while you are
all life and sunshine. Minnie, you know I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Hush! You mustn’t say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> I know I’m not worthy of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> That’s the first sensible thing he has
said yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Have you ever said it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Of course not. I have been worthy of
her all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> Your happiness would be everything to
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I think you mean what you say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> He doesn’t! The beast!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> Now for a small confession. Ever so
long ago I bought a ring, in hope, or, perhaps, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
despair. Whenever my chances seemed most faint,
fortune most forbidding, I used to take it out of
my pocket and look at it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Silly ass! Can you imagine a more
deplorable waste of time? Whenever a man is down
on his luck to take out a ring and look at it? Oh,
dear, oh, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> Am I forgiven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> You are silly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> There! See? She agrees with me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> May I put it on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> (<i>Bus. with ring</i>) Oh, Arthur, how
lovely! Oh, what a beauty! Oh, it is ever so much
prettier than——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Of course. Of course. How like a
woman! The diamonds are bigger and that settles
the whole thing! (<i>Lights down within house, only
the exterior now shown.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Never mind, you said you were going
to buy her a thimble to-morrow. What’s a diamond
ring to a thimble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I meant a present. I didn’t particularize
so, I simply called it a thimble. But I’ll buy her
a star to-morrow—an enormous star of diamonds.
I’ll make Mr. Dicey sit up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> So like a man. He thinks if the
diamonds are bigger that will settle the whole thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Of course it is unnecessary. Minnie
would not marry a brainless idiot like Dicey. Aunt
Martha would see to that. After all, Aunt Martha
is a sensible woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Though somewhat narrow-minded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> She can’t help that, poor thing. Aunt
Martha would never sit still and see Minnie sacrificed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Quite true. Let us hear her wishes.
(<i>Waves his hand and interior is again illuminated.
<span class="smcap">Aunt</span> and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence</span> are discovered seated.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence.</span> I am so sorry Horace was not
able to come with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> That is Mrs. Clarence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> So am I, for his sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence.</span> What did you say was the matter
with him? Influenza?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Did I say that? Well, I suppose influenza
is as good a name for it as any other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence.</span> It sounds as if Master Horace
had been naughty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Julia, dear, I am much worried about
him—I am indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Good old Aunt Martha! She’s not such
a bad sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence.</span> What is the matter with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> My dear, he has taken a turn for the
worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence.</span> Have you sent for a doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> No, I haven’t. It is more of a moral complaint
than physical. He thinks of nothing and nobody
but himself. He quite neglects Minnie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence.</span> What a shame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> And I can’t sit still and see Minnie sacrificed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence.</span> I should think not, indeed. How
pretty she looks to-night. Horace is engaged to her,
isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I’m glad to say it is broken off. He has
nobody to blame but himself. She plucked up courage
this evening and gave him his congé.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence.</span> So that’s it. Influenza has a
lot to answer for. Excuse me a moment, dear.
(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarence</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Must I listen to all this twaddle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Your intimates don’t appear to think
very highly of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I don’t care two straws for their opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Don’t you value the praise of your
fellow men?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> My fellow men—oh, yes. But not such
creatures as these. Men of the world, men of business,
hard-headed men of science. Take their opinions.
I venture to say they will speak of me with
respect and very possibly with admiration.</p>

Horace like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What? What did she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> He certainly never cared for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Oh, you wicked old woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> There was only one person he was ever
in love with, and that was himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I know it now. I was giving everything,
he nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Men are like that, my dear. They are all
alike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Not all, Auntie. There’s Arthur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Arthur is the exception, at least I hope so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, he is very different from Horace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I should hope he was, and you’ll find
it out, my young lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You have had a very narrow escape. Arthur

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, Auntie, don’t say that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Pig! I do say it! I will say it! It describes
him exactly. Horace is a pig!</p>

fearfully narrow-minded! I’m jolly well out
of it, and I’m jolly glad to be so jolly well out of it!
One thing I know—I’ll never speak to another
woman again as long as I live.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>The Waits are heard singing a carol.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> You are still devoted to self in spite
of the poor opinion of your friends. Have you no
suspicion of yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> It strikes me that there is a lot of guess-work
about you, and what’s more, you are making
some uncommonly bad shots. You’ve pitched on me
as an example of selfishness. Now, I’m not selfish.
It’s the other people who are selfish. Not I.</p>

Where’s a policeman? I’ll have them moved on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Why, listen to them! That’s why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> They are singing for charity. What
they receive they give away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Nonsense! They are singing because

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, they’re making a jolly row about
it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Have you ever done anything for
others?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Permit me a word. You have advanced
not a single argument why my conduct should be
deemed reprehensible. We are quite well aware of
our duty to each other, but in our highly organized
society to-day we employ the important principle of
the Division of Labor. Some attend to Charities,
others to Science, others again to Production or
Distribution, and so on and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Continue your divisions,—some do
the fun-making and some do the grieving, some do
the feasting and some the fasting. You, Prince of
Duncedom, go gather rainbows, photograph a sunset,
make a dyke of sponge, a castle on quicksand, a
pillar of jelly. It were as wise as to build a Society
on Self. That is a cement of gunpowder which
dries in time and, gathering force, shatters a continent.
In all your heart-breaking history but one
order has been founded upon Love. It has been
growing slowly since the first Christmas. Tell this
to your politicians, your false judges, to the fringe
of corruption at the base of the Law, and to all
others panting and raging round the Golden Grab-bag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Oh, I see how it is. You have been
reading our newspapers. They blackguard everything,
themselves included. But now, Marsy, you
must allow there has been a tremendous plunge
ahead in the last hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> None! A great hubbub of Invention
has been made, but what of Otherdom? A terrific
rush to the standard of Mammon. “Arm!
arm!” is the cry, “for the great Battle of Buy and
Sell.” Invention echoes, “here are swords for all
and any—good or bad, right or wrong, no question.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
False foods, false drinks, false houses, false public
service. Invent! Invent! Railways for War to
travel on, the grand science of Butchery, no question!
Telegraphs to swindle by, Advertisements of
any fraud, no question! And still your vaunted
Progress bellows, “More Swords! More Swords!”</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>At rise of curtain there should be shown on a transparency

bending over the <span class="smcap">Tramp</span> and <span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>
soaring homewards. At the same time <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
himself is seen sleeping in his chair, breathing
heavily. With the first clanging of the fire-engine
bell and <span class="smcap">Horace</span> waking up, the lights
increase at back and the dream scene fades
away. The lamp is now seen to be lighted
again, the fire burning brightly, and an “Extra”
evening paper lying on table, close to <span class="smcap">Horace</span>.
After sufficient pause after curtain is up, a fire
engine is heard rumbling past from <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> to <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> outside,

wake, as the transparency picture fades away.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Marsy, old boy, you have a lot to answer
for! Fancy my dreaming I was hungry! Comes of
eating a heavy dinner. (<i>With a sudden thought.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
By Jove! (<i>Searches his pockets for his money.
Finds it with a sigh of relief. Counts his notes
carefully.</i>) Ten, twenty, fifty, and one. All there.
(<i>Pulls out some silver from his trousers pocket.</i>)
Even the silver. Very careless, very careless of me.
I can hardly be trusted out at night with so much.
I might in a weak moment hand it over to some
hospital amid the admiring cheers of the populace.
I must watch myself.</p>

nobody heard me. My nerves are all on edge. I
wish old Marsy would tell me whether that inventive
vagabond got over his troubles or peacefully expired
in the snow. Poor devil! I almost wish I could
meet him again. We call such fellows riff-raff, rabble,
but, if the truth were told, might not some of
us be found to be the real loafers in the snug corners
of Easy Street, of little good to anyone, cumbering
up the way till that old patrolman, Death,
steps up and bids us “Move on”?</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Bella</span> abruptly and alarmed, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Oh, sir, did you call?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Call? (<i>Innocently.</i>) Call what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Fire, sir. Fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Fire is all right. Burning nicely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Yes, sir. Perhaps it was the fire engine
going by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Very likely. Very likely. Did one go
by?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Yes, sir—and I was half dozing, and——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> You must have been dreaming, Bella.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
That’s very wrong. You shouldn’t. It’s a bad
habit to get into. However, as you are sleepy you
needn’t wait up. I shan’t sleep again. I mean I
don’t think I shall feel like going to sleep at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> (<i>Aside</i>) As if I didn’t see him asleep.
I think I would like to go to bed, sir, if you think
Miss Minnie won’t want anything. They can’t be
long now, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No. You go to bed. By the way, did
you fill the lamp?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Yes, sir, and made up the fire, and
brought you in your “Extra.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Extra? (<i>Almost reeling with nervousness.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Yes, sir, I put it on the table. Oh, sir,
are you ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Ill? No. What an idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> You were so—so busy, sir, when I came
in with the oil, I didn’t like to wa—— to disturb
you, sir. Good night, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Good night, Bella. (<i>She exits <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>) Then
there was an Extra in reality. That was not all
dream. There it is. What made me dream of the
bank smash if nothing had been said about it? I
dreamt of Mars. I had been reading of Mars. At
this moment, great heavens, I may be, in very fact,
a ruined man! (<i>Seizes paper with trembling hands
and finds the place. Reads.</i>) Not a word! (<i>Wipes
his forehead.</i>) Not a word, but <i>there might have
been</i>! And why should this house not be burning
as well as the one that is? What would I do? Cut
my throat! An arrant coward’s refuge, after all.
Ah, from the beggar’s point of view, wealth seemed
so flinty hearted, while charity was natural and easy
to the poor. (<i>Fire engine.</i>) Evidently no false
alarm this time. Somebody sick with anxiety and
dread to-night. Heaven help them, whoever they
are! What a rap Marsy would give me for that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
speech. He’d say, “Help them yourself. Don’t
overtax Heaven.” Pshaw, I’d only be in the way.
We have an excellent fire department. Best in the
world. And there are so many need helping. How
many lines of this paper tell of suffering, and how
much may we read between the lines! (<i>Skims over
paper.</i>) “Wanted, plain sewing, to do at home.”
“Young man wants work. Will do anything honest.”
Honest? He is particular for these days.
And I swore to Marsy that I wouldn’t take back my
money except to share it with others. He might
have made favorable terms with me just then. (<i>Sees
ring on table.</i>) Minnie’s ring. My trying to bully
her. It was the act of a cur! I’ll tell her so. I’ll—(<i>Fire
engine passes.</i>) Another! It must be serious.
(<i>Looks through curtains of window <span class="allsmcap">C.</span></i>) What
a sheet of flame! It must be in the next street. It
may reach here. (<i>Looks intently.</i>) No, the wind’s
the other way. (<i>Relieved.</i>) That tenement house,
I’ll be bound! Poor people, what will they do this
bitter night if they are burnt out? I don’t know
what I could do if I really wanted to. I think I’ll
put on my coat and hat and go and see. Don’t suppose
I’ll do much harm looking on. (<i>Fire-engine
bell again. He looks out again.</i>) Ladder escape.
(<i>Dresses a little quicker now.</i>) I might take an extra
coat for some one. (<i>Goes to closet containing
several overcoats and takes one. Hesitates and

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Mr. Dicey, you must wait awhile till you

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> It is very late, and I must not intrude.

dressed as quick as I could, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Oh, it is not your fault, Bella.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I’ll warrant he has gone to bed. Just like

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> We must do something by way of return.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> Just order the car as if it were your own.

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I was going to pour you out a glass—but
I’m a little afraid——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicey.</span> All the wines of Bacchus would be less

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Yes, cheer up, folk! We’ll see you on
your feet again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Working Man.</span> Thank you, Mister. That’s
a kind word, no mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> No doctor yet? I’ll go myself. Where
is our doctor? (<i>He lifts his fur cap off a child’s
head and gets his scarf from another.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Dr. Chapman is only a few doors down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
on the right. You’ll know the house by the red
light. (<i><span class="smcap">Horace</span> is going <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> A knock on front door
heard.</i>) Perhaps that is the doctor.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Horace</span> goes out and brings <span class="smcap">Dr. Chapman</span> in <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> This is the worst case, Doctor.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Dr. Chapman</span> goes to lad on sofa. Enter <span class="smcap">Bella</span>
<span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Some of the rooms are ready, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Will you dispose them, Auntie? (<i>Apart
to her</i>) I ought to apologize to you for bringing in
all this crowd without asking you, but you see what
a deplorable——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> (<i>Patting his shoulder</i>) Nephew, I am
proud of you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Funny! I thought she’d kick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Let this old couple come first, and the
children, and you. (<i><span class="smcap">Aunt Martha</span> shepherds
about half the crowd off <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> and exits.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Horace</span></i>) Boy is in a bad way,
Guv’ner, but Doctor thinks he can pull him through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> You brought him in. I thought he was
your son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> No, Miss, I ain’t got no son, only a
daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Has he no friends?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> His mother was burnt up, Miss, to-night.
(<i><span class="smcap">Minnie</span> nearly faints, and <span class="smcap">Horace</span> catches
her. She gently removes herself from his arms.</i>)
Excuse me, Miss, I was too blunt with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> There, Minnie, don’t give way. They
will need your help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> (<i>Enter <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>) The other rooms are ready,
sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Can you walk now better? Don’t cry,
we will get you some clothes in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Working Woman.</span> God bless your kind
heart, Miss, and you, sir. We’d have died if you
hadn’t come.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Minnie</span> shows them off with <span class="smcap">Bella</span> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, and exits
with crowd.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> What is to be done, Doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Chapman.</span> Well, if you wish to turn your
house into a hospital, all right. To save his life, he
must be put to bed at once, and kept there.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Aunt Martha</span> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> Sees lad on sofa.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Oh, how could I? I have forgotten the
principal sufferer, and there is not another room
left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Have you used mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Horace!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Let him have that. May it save him is
all I say! Now how to move him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Chapman.</span> Carry him as he is, sofa and all.
That will save a good deal of strain.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Dr. Chapman</span>, <span class="smcap">Horace</span> and <span class="smcap">Tramp</span> carry out boy
on sofa <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Minnie</span> enters as they exeunt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Where can they be going to put that
poor boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Horace insists upon giving up his bed and
room to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> (<i>Astounded</i>) No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> (<i>Sharing her wonderment</i>) Yes. (<i>They
look at each other for a moment in silence.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Well, I can believe it after what he has
been doing at the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Do you know, Minnie, I hardly think you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
should call a man, with a mind rather above social
small talk, selfish, because he doesn’t care to go to
your balls with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> It was you who said he was selfish. I
was willing to give up the dance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I don’t dance. You have misjudged him.
He is the soul of generosity. Do you know, he actually
began excusing himself to me for bringing the
poor people in out of the cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Fancy those babies sleeping through it
all! Weren’t they sweet? (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Tramp</span> and <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
<span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> And you, my poor fellow! I must find a
corner for you somewhere. You have no home now,
I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> No, ma’m. I’ve done without a home
for several moons. So I’m used to it, but it’s tough
on those who get it sudden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I’m interested in this man. I showed
him scant courtesy this evening, and felt sorry for
him afterwards. We met again at the fire. He is an
inventor, moreover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Ah, Guv’ner, if they had only had my
fire-escape there would have been no killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Have you an idea for a fire-escape?
By Jove, we’ll patent it! Meanwhile——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Will you give me the job of cleaning
the snow from your front walks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Yes, and I will pay you in advance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Needn’t do that, Guv.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You will find a shovel in the coal shed, if
not——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> A bit of board will do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Shovel’s best, Guv’ner——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I mean, of course—oh, yes, a shovel, by
all means. The servants are up, and if you don’t
object to eating before retiring, for there’s no hurry
about the snow——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> I doesn’t object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Will you show him the way to the kitchen,
Minnie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Minnie? Is that her name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Why, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> I’m looking for a daughter of that name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Who were Minnie’s parents, Aunt? Do
you know? Can it be possible that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> That this young lady is mine? Lor’, no,
Guv’ner! My daughter would only be about twelve
years old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Why, you said she was the image of
your——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> Me? Never, Guv’ner. Never saw this
lady before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Not you, no, I remember. It was someone
else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Your mother knew both Minnie’s parents.
Her father was a clergyman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tramp.</span> And I ain’t exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I am sure you have a brave as well as
a kind heart, for I have heard from others what
risks you took in carrying them out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Well, take a substantial supper—or
breakfast, whichever it may be called—and presently
we’ll clear that snow off together. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Tramp</span>
with <span class="smcap">Minnie</span> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> What do you mean by clearing the snow
together?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I fancy the exercise will stimulate
thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> My dear Horace, I am truly ashamed of
the abuse I heaped upon you this evening. Do forgive
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Why, Aunt, I’m sure I had well earned
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> What a noble reproof you have administered
by this turning of your house into a common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
lodging place, you who so dislike being disturbed, and
I thought abominated the lower class. I’m afraid I
should have hesitated long before I invited them in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Not if you had seen them as I did. Oh,
Auntie, why have we so little Otherdom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Other—what, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> That is, philanthropy, benevolence, altruism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> I am sure you have done your full share
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> It can only be because we never realize
how the poor live. In the wise days of old, when
men were nearer nature, fast days were instituted,
that the Fat might remember the Lean. Now our
Fasts are feasts. I wonder what a bonafide all-round
forty-eight hour starve, once a year even,
would do for our rich friends. Make that a fad,
Auntie. You’d revolutionize the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> You are quite right, Horace. We do fall
far short of our whole duty. But where are you
going to sleep? Will you go to a hotel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Perhaps, or in the chair. Don’t bother
about me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> Kiss me, Horace. Heaven bless you.
You have made me very happy to-night. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> The sofa gone. I see nothing for it but
to camp on the hearthrug or in the chair. Don’t
want that any more. (<i>Turns out lamp.</i>) I wish I
could have made my peace with Minnie. But she
hasn’t forgotten so readily. She shrank away from
me when I caught her. I must just hope for the
best. (<i>Settles down in chair.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Minnie</span> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Light out—then I am too late. He has
gone to some hotel. I wonder how the fire is doing?
(<i>Goes to window and pulls curtains away, when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
morning light falls upon her. <span class="smcap">Horace</span>, aroused, sees
her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> I might be dreaming again. Ah, I can
read it now! She is my guide—my Marsy—my conscience!
Minnie!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> (<i>Startled</i>) Horace?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Forgive me, Minnie! I was a brute to
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> I wronged you, Horace. I know I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Never! Never! It was your spirit
that changed me, and my purpose in life. Help me
to continue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> What can I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> (<i>Picks up ring from table</i>) Let me put
it back on its finger. (<i>Sounds of scraping of shovel
outside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> (<i>Goes to window and looks out</i>) It is
that poor inventor man shoveling the snow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> There is good in him, and we will bring
it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> And shall we help him to find his Minnie,
now that you have found yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> That we will, dearest. (<i>Puts on ring.</i>)
There it is again, my love, my Minnie!</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Tramp</span> comes into view through window shoveling
the snow cheerily.</i>)</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h3>Golden Days</h3>

<p>A comedy of youth, in four acts, by Sidney Toler and
Marion Short. 7 males, 10 females. Three interior
scenes. Costumes modern. Plays 2½ hours.</p>

<p>“Golden Days” is a play with all the charm of youth.
It enjoyed a run of sixteen weeks in Chicago with
Patricia Collinge in the leading role, and was then
brought to the Gaiety Theatre, New York, with Helen
Hayes in the part of “Mary Anne.”</p>

<p class="right">Price, 75 cents.</p>

<h3>Come Out of the Kitchen</h3>

<p>A charming comedy in 3 acts, adapted by A. E. Thomas
from the story of the same name by Alice Duer Miller. 6
males, 5 females. Three interior scenes. Costumes,
modern. Plays 2½ hours.</p>

<p>“Come Out of the Kitchen,” with Ruth Chatterton in
the leading role, made a notable success on its production
by Henry Miller at the Cohan Theatre, New York.
It was also a great success at the Strand Theatre, London.
A most ingenious and entertaining comedy, and
we strongly recommend it for amateur production.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 75 cents</p>

<h3>His Majesty Bunker Bean</h3>

<p>A farcical comedy in four acts. By Lee Wilson Dodd,
from the novel by Harry Leon Wilson. 12 males, 6
females. Four interior scenes. Costumes, modern. Plays
2½ hours. Those who have laughed immoderately at
Harry Leon Wilson’s story will be greatly amused by
the play, which tells the story of a cowed and credulous
youth who became kingly when he was tricked
into believing himself a reincarnation of Napoleon. “His
Majesty Bunker Bean,” with Taylor Holmes in the title
role, was brought to the Astor Theatre, New York,
after a run of 25 weeks in Chicago. A delightful and
wholesome farce comedy with no dull moments.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 75 cents</p>

<h3>A Full House</h3>

<p>A farcical comedy in three acts. By Fred Jackson.
7 males, 7 females. One interior scene. Modern costumes.
Plays 2½ hours. This newest and funniest of
all farces was written by Fred Jackson, the well-known
short story writer, and is backed up by the prestige
of an impressive New York success and the promise of
unlimited fun presented in the most attractive form.
A cleverer farce has not been seen for many a long
day. “A Full House” is a house full of laughs.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 75 cents</p>

<h3>The Charm School</h3>

<p>A fascinating comedy in three acts by Alice Duer Miller
and Robert Milton. 6 males, 10 females. (May be
played by 5 males and 8 females). Any number of school
girls may be used in the ensembles. Scenes, two interiors.
Costumes, modern. Plays 2½ hours.</p>

<p>The story of “The Charm School” is familiar to Mrs.
Miller’s readers. It relates the adventures of a handsome
young automobile salesman scarcely out of his
’teens who, upon inheriting a girl’s boarding school from
a maiden aunt, insists on running it himself, according to
his own ideas, chief of which is, by the way, that the
dominant feature in the education of the young girl of
to-day should be CHARM.</p>

<p>The situations that arise are teeming with humor—clean,
wholesome humor. In the end the young man
gives up the school and promises to wait until the most
precocious of his pupils reaches a marriageable age.</p>

<p>“The Charm School” has the freshness of youth, the
inspiration of an extravagant but novel idea, the charm
of originality, and the promise of wholesome, sanely
amusing, pleasant entertainment. We strongly recommend
it for high school production.</p>

<p>“The Charm School” was first produced at the Bijou
Theatre, New York, and then toured the country. Two
companies are now playing it in England.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 75 cents.</p>

<h3>Daddy Long-Legs</h3>

<p>A charming comedy in four acts, by Jean Webster.
The full cast calls for 6 males, 7 females and 6 orphans,
but the play, by the easy doubling of some of the characters
may be played by 4 males, 4 females and three
orphans. The orphans appear only in the first act and
may be played by small girls of any age. Four easy
interior scenes. Costumes modern. Plays 2½ hours.</p>

<p>The New York Times reviewer, on the morning following
the Broadway production, wrote the following
comment:</p>

<p>“If you will take your pencil and write down, one below
the other, the words delightful, charming, sweet,
beautiful and entertaining, and then draw a line and
add them up, the answer will be ‘Daddy Long-Legs.’
To that result you might even add brilliant, pathetic
and humorous, but the answer even then would be just
what it was before—the play which Miss Jean Webster
has made from her book, ‘Daddy Long-Legs,’ and which
was presented at the Gaiety last night. To attempt to
describe the simplicity and beauty of ‘Daddy Long-Legs’
would be like attempting to describe the first breath of
Spring after an exceedingly tiresome and hard Winter.”</p>

<p>“Daddy Long-Legs” enjoyed a two-years’ run in New
York and was then toured for over three years, and is
now published in play form for the first time.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 75 cents.</p>

<h3>BILLETED.</h3>

<p>A comedy in 3 acts, by F. Tennison Jesse and H. Harwood. 4
males, 5 females. One easy interior scene. A charming comedy,
constructed with uncommon skill, and abounds with clever lines.
Margaret Anglin’s big success. Amateurs will find this comedy easy
to produce and popular with all audiences.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 60 Cents.</p>

<h3>NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.</h3>

<p>A comedy in 3 acts. By James Montgomery. 5 males, 6 females.
Costumes, modern. Two interior scenes. Plays 2 and ½ hours.</p>

<p>Is it possible to tell the absolute truth—even for twenty-four hours?
It is—at least Bob Bennett, the hero of “Nothing But the Truth,”
accomplished the feat. The bet he made with his business partners,
and the trouble he got into—with his partners, his friends, and his
fiancée—this is the subject of William Collier’s tremendous comedy
hit. “Nothing But the Truth” can be whole-heartedly recommended
as one of the most sprightly, amusing and popular comedies that this
country can boast.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 60 Cents.</p>

<h3>IN WALKED JIMMY.</h3>

<p>A comedy in 4 acts, by Minnie Z. Jaffa. 10 males, 2 females (although
any number of males and females may be used as clerks,
etc.). Two interior scenes. Costumes, modern. Plays 2 and ½ hours.
The thing into which Jimmy walked was a broken-down shoe factory,
when the clerks had all been fired, and when the proprietor was in
serious contemplation of suicide.</p>

<p>Jimmy, nothing else but plain Jimmy, would have been a mysterious
figure had it not been for his matter-of-fact manner, his smile and
his everlasting humanness. He put the shoe business on its feet, won
the heart of the girl clerk, saved her erring brother from jail, escaped
that place as a permanent boarding house himself, and foiled the
villain.</p>

<p>Clean, wholesome comedy with just a touch of human nature, just
a dash of excitement and more than a little bit of true philosophy
make “In Walked Jimmy” one of the most delightful of plays.
Jimmy is full of the religion of life, the religion of happiness and
the religion of helpfulness, and he so permeates the atmosphere with
his “religion” that everyone is happy. The spirit of optimism, good
cheer, and hearty laughter dominates the play. There is not a dull
moment in any of the four acts. We strongly recommend it.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 60 Cents.</p>

<h3>MARTHA BY-THE-DAY.</h3>

<p>An optimistic comedy in three acts, by Julie M. Lippmann, author
of the “Martha” stories. 5 males, 5 females. Three interior scenes.
Costumes modern. Plays 2 and ½ hours.</p>

<p>It is altogether a gentle thing, this play. It is full of quaint humor,
old-fashioned, homely sentiment, the kind that people who see
the play will recall and chuckle over to-morrow and the next day.</p>

<p>Miss Lippmann has herself adapted her very successful book for
stage service, and in doing this has selected from her novel the most
telling incidents, infectious comedy and homely sentiment for the
play, and the result is thoroughly delightful.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 60 Cents.</p>
